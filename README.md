# COVID-19-in-Canada
This repository contains the final group project for the course **"CST2106 - Data Visualization Topics"** course, part of the Business Intelligence Systems Infrastructure program at Algonquin College of Advanced Technology.

This project aimed to present our understanding of Data Visualization tools such as Tableau and Microsoft Power BI on a given topic. The topic we chose was **"Is COVID-19 REALLY over?"**, which addressed the inquiry regarding the extent to which COVID-19's impacts on various socioeconomic factors have diminished, and whether these factors have returned to their pre-COVID-19 levels. 

We explored the epidemiological impacts of COVID-19 throughout the different provinces of Canada, along with the socioeconomic impacts on employment, housing market and trade business in Canada, by comparing the difference between pre-COVID and post-COVID data. 

The datasets for analysis were collected from several sources, mainly from the websites of the Government of Canada, Statistics Canada, CREA Statistics, and the World Bank.

An image of the dashboard has been shared here for sample purposes. The actual working .twbx file and cleaned datasets are available on request.
